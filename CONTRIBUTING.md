## Contributing

As a rule of thumb:

Unless the change is done for compatbility reasons, do **not** make any creative decisions for the project without contacting me (EladNLG).

You're welcome to decide e.g. how an oxygen bar would look were it added, but please avoid changing pre-existing elements.

Minor changes (e.g. adding transparency around the bars to avoid aliasing issues), however, are completely fine.

### I have the final say.

If you want to do something for april fools: Keep it silly.

And I get the ad rev.
